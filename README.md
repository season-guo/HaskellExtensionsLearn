This is a repo about showing how to use Haskell GHC Extensions

It include 

- Examples
- Explanations
- Some differences between enabled and disabled
- Some of my thoughts

About the sequence, I write according to [this](https://limperg.de/ghc-extensions), you can follow it too to get a better understanding.

When I write it it, my ghc version is 9.6.2, but the code should be compatible with ghc 8.6 and above.

Wish you enjoy it!
