This is a repo about showing how to use Haskell GHC Extensions

It include 

- Examples
- Explanations
- Some differences between enabled and disabled
- Some of my thoughts

About the sequence, I write according to [this](https://limperg.de/ghc-extensions), you can follow it too to get a better understanding.

When I write it , my ghc version is 9.6.2, but the code should be compatible with ghc 8.6 and above.

If you know little about Type Level Programming, 
I recommend you to read [this](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/04/26/basic_type_level_programming_in_haskell.html). 
It's a really short but good article that helps you understand some concepts better, 
if you don't want to, well, just remember you should start from DataKinds extension, unless you can not catch the type families right

Wish you enjoy it!
